## Daily development flow

1. Check your current branch.

   ```js
   git branch
   ```

2. Create your branch. A new branch is the copy of your current branch.

   ```
   git branch my-test-branch
   ```

3. Switch the branch that you created.

   ```js
    git checkout my-test-branch
   ```

4. Change code.

5. Commit your changes. Your changes are saved in `Staging Area`

   ```js
   git status
   git add .
   git commit -m "added new function"
   ```

6. Push your change to remote repository

   ```js
   git push origin [your branch name]
   ```

7. Login GitHub and check to see if your branch exists.
